Acme-Ünicöde

This distribution is primarily made to learn where Unicode works and
where not. Does it work in filenames? As module name? Are sub names
ok? If yes, then where do I need to "use utf8;" and where not. How far
can PAUSE and CPAN handle it? If you read this then CPAN at least
survived the upload.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

In reality I hope to never have to give any kind of support for this
module; I'm lucky if all goes well for myself. :-) But YOU are invited
to support ME if you know how to do it better.

However, module-starter gave me that nice theoretical boilerplate, and
it shows some nice situations where things can go wrong for
itself. Try them out and see how broken or how well it looks.

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
